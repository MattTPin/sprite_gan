# sprite_gan

Project Completed in February 2021 which used a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate novel sprite images based on the characteristics in the provided dataset. This was achieved by creating two neural networks. This includes a generator to create images and a discriminator to check if the images possess characteristics similar to those in the original dataset.

The results of running the model for its first (roughly) 300 itterations can be seen below.
