# sprite_gan

Project Completed in February 2021 which used a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate novel sprite images based on the characteristics in the provided dataset. This was achieved by creating two neural networks. This includes a generator to create images and a discriminator to check if the images possess characteristics similar to those in the original dataset.

The following result can be seen from running the model over 500 itterationâ€¦
